# emojify
Converts any text into an emojipasta by matching words to emojis, and adding filler emojis every now and then.

To be used for humorous effect (by spamming emojis).

There are currently 6k+ hardcoded emoji-word mappings in the text file, which should be decent.

## Use Guide
Download emojipasta.py and emojipasta.txt from the repository.

In your Linux terminal, run the command `python3 emojipasta.py "whatever text you want to add"`.

Make sure to put quotes around the text!

```
your_username@HOSTNAME:~$ python3 emojipasta.py "The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start."
